**CipherTalkGo** is a high-performance, distributed instant messaging application that ensures confidentiality and
security of communication through the use of end-to-end encryption and blockchain technology. Developed using the Go
programming language, the application is designed to provide a reliable and secure communication environment without
storing conversations on the server.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted from sender to recipient, ensuring that only they can read them.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Users register and interact directly, without the need for data storage on the server.
- **Proof of Authorship**: Signing each message using the Ed25519 algorithm confirms its authenticity.
- **Scalability**: Ready for scaling thanks to the ability to add master-slave shards.
- **Ease of Use**: The CLI interface simplifies the process of connecting and using the application.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: [Go](https://golang.org/)
- **Encryption**: ECDH and Ed25519
- **Network Protocols**: TCP/IP
- **Authorization**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Development

The application is developed with a focus on the practice and mastery of the following technologies:

- Working with the Go network stack
- Applying principles of security and encryption
- Developing distributed systems
